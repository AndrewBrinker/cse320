    <ol>
        <li>Chapter 9 of PLAI. It is highly recommend to do the exercises in the book.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The focus in this reading should be on the following concepts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What is a recursive data structure?</li>
        <li>What is a cyclic data structure?</li>
        <li>What does it mean for a computation to <em>diverge</em>?</li>
        <li>Why does creating a cyclic datum require a box?</li>
        <li>Why can't you write recursive functions without boxing?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This reading is actually linked at the end of chapter 9 in PLAI!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen explaining how to get recursion without explicit state, in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/sample.pdf">this chapter from their book <em>The Little Schemer</em></a>. Note that you will probably need to read this at least twice to understand what they're describing. This is some trippy stuff.</li>

        <li><a href="http://maartenfokkinga.github.io/utwente/mmf91m.pdf">&ldquo;Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire&rdquo;</a> by Erik Meijer (major contributor to Câ™¯, Haskell, lead developer of LINQ, one of the guys from the video on the first day of class), Maarten Fokkinga, and Ross Paterson.</li>
        <li>If the above is a bit much, try <a href="http://blog.sumtypeofway.com/an-introduction-to-recursion-schemes/">&ldquo;An Introduction to Recursion Schemes&rdquo;</a> by Patrick Thomson, which summarizes the above paper in a more approachable way.</li>
