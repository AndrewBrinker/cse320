    <ol>
        <li>Chapter 12 of PLAI. It is highly recommend to do the exercises in the book.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The focus in this reading should be on the following concepts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What is "representation"?</li>
        <li>What happens when a language's features are mapped directly to equivalent host language features?</li>
        <li>What are the pros and cons of using existing host language features to represent your language features?</li>
        <li>What are two ways the book gives to represent closures?</li>
        <li>What are two ways the book gives to represent the environment?</li>
    </ul>

        <li><a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2016/02/08/a-lambda-is-not-necessarily-a-closure">&ldquo;A lambda is not (necessarily) a closure&rdquo;</a> by Andy Wingo. This is an interesting example of a representation decision in a real programming language. Astute observers will also notice that this had previously been assigned as an advanced reading a few weeks ago. Hopefully it's more approachable now!</li>
