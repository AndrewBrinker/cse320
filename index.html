						<h3 id="required-materials"><a href="#required-materials">Required Materials</a></h3>

						<p>This course requires the second edition of <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/">&ldquo;Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation&rdquo;</a> by <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>. This book is available for free online in both <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> formats, and need not be purchased, although students may purchase it if they want to do so.</p>

						<p>Before each class, be sure to read any assigned chapters of the book, as well as any additional materials included in the syllabus.</p>


						<h3 id="optional-materials"><a href="#optional-materials">Optional Materials</a></h3>

						<p>Each pre-course reading will include optional materials. Questions from these optional materials will be included for extra points in the quiz given at the start of each class session.</p>

						<h3 id="advanced-materials"><a href="#advanced-materials">Advanced Materials</a></h3>

						<p>Some pre-course reading will include links or suggestions for further exploration into the topic at hand. These are entirely for your own personal edification, and will not be required for use in the course.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="structure">
						<h2><a href="#structure">Structure</a></h2>

						<p>This course is organized into two components, a class component and a lab component. The class component will serve to enable discussion and exploration of the topics covered in reading. To do well in this class, <em>you must do the assigned reading</em>. Students who arrive to class without having done the reading will likely find themselves struggling.</p>
						<p>Each class session will begin with a quiz whose questions are based on the information covered in the reading assigned after the previous class session. Each quiz will additionally have questions based on any optional reading, for extra points. See the <a href="#grading">Grading</a> section for more information on how these quizzes are graded, and how that grade contributes to your final grade in the course.</p>
						<p>The lab component will serve to introduce you to a variety of programming languages, to provide practical knowledge about different languages, their underlying paradigms, and how the different decisions the language designers make influence the resulting language.

							<p>There are a total of 500 points available in this course. Your final grade is based solely on how many points out of 500 you have received. The letter grade breakdown is as follows.</p>
