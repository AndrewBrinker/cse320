                                <li>Participate in class discussions. This class will be collaborative and explorational, and that is best facilitated when everyone participates. You don't need to do a lot, but share your ideas, and ask questions when you have them.</li>
                                <li>Do the reading before each class. Do the optional reading if you can. You&rsquo;ll get a lot more out of the class with the optional reading.</li>

I am here as a resource to you, and my number one goal is making sure you learn the material and succeed in the course. The sooner you reach out, the better we will be able to address the problem.</li>

                                <p>This course requires the second edition of <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/">&ldquo;Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation&rdquo;</a> by <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>. This book is available for free online in both <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> formats, and need not be purchased, although students may purchase it if they want to do so.</p>

                                <p>Before each class, be sure to read any assigned chapters of the book, as well as any additional materials included in the syllabus.</p>

                                <p>Each pre-course reading will include optional materials. Questions from these optional materials will be included for extra points in the quiz given at the start of each class session.</p>

                                <p>Some pre-course reading will include links or suggestions for further exploration into the topic at hand. These are entirely for your own personal edification, and will not be required for use in the course.</p>

                                <p>The class component will serve to enable discussion and exploration of the topics covered in reading. To do well in this class, <em>you must do the assigned reading</em>. Students who arrive to class without having done the reading will likely find themselves struggling.</p>
                                <p>Each class session will begin with a quiz whose questions are based on the information covered in the reading assigned after the previous class session. Each quiz will additionally have questions based on any optional reading, for extra points. See the <a href="#grading">Grading</a> section for more information on how these quizzes are graded, and how that grade contributes to your final grade in the course.</p>

                                <h3 id="lab-component"><a href="#lab-component">Lab Component</a></h3>

                                <p>The lab component will serve to introduce you to a variety of programming languages, to provide practical knowledge about different languages, their underlying paradigms, and how the different decisions the language designers make influence the resulting language.</p>
                                <p>The lab will consist of exercises and programming assignments designed to provide hands-on experience with the given languages and their paradigms.</p>

                                <p>Grading in the course is based on points. There are four ways to get points: quizzes, labs, the course project, and the final. There will be 18 quizzes each worth 5 points, 10 labs each worth 20 points, 1 project worth 110 points, and 1 final worth 100 points.</p>

                            <h3 id="goals"><a href="#goals">Goals</a></h3>

                            <p>One of the goals of this course is to combat language monoculture. If you as a programmer only use one language, you are only exposed to one way of thinking. The languages we use (whether speaking or programming) shape the ideas we consider and express. Learning more than one programming language is akin to learning more than one spoken language. In doing so, you help to broaden yourself with new perspectives and ways of thinking.</p>
                            <p>It is not expected that you become a strong programmer in each of these languages. Rather, the hope is that the exposure you receive to these languages will pay dividends in improving your understanding of and facility with programming overall. If you happen to like one or more of these languages, and want to explore them further on your own time, do.</p>

                            <h3 id="Organization"><a href="#organization">Organization</a></h3>

                            <p>Labs in this class will consist of a series of exercises or a programming assignment in one of the <a href="#languages-in-the-lab">four languages being used in the lab</a>. These labs are designed to be reasonably completed within the hour and fifty minutes alloted. For students who finish with extra time and want to explore the languages in question further, additional resources or exercises will often be provided.</p>
                            <p>Lab time is a time for experimentation, discovery, and question-asking (both of yourself and of me). The best way to discover the workings of a programming language is to write in it, and so I highly recommend a sense of playfulness during lab sessions. I will be available for questions, and if more than one or two students has the same question I am happy to answer those questions for the edification of the rest of the students.</p>

                            <h3 id="languages-in-the-lab"><a href="#languages-in-the-lab">Languages in the Lab</a></h3>

                            <p>The lab is organized into four segments, each using a particular language. These languages were chosen because they best typify the core concepts of the programming paradigm they represent.</p>
                            <p>In these labs we will be using <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> (to represent functional programming), <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> (to represent structured programming), <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/">Java</a> (to represent object-oriented programming), and <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">Prolog</a> to represent logic programming). These languages are all quite different, and there is enough nuance in each to fill multiple classes. So we will only be spending a few weeks with each language.</p>

                    <section id="project">
                        <h2><a href="#project">Project</a></h2>
                        <p>The course will include a project to be undertaken in teams of 3&ndash;5 students. Each member of a team will receive the same grade, so make sure to pick team members on whom you can rely.</p>
                        <p>The task for the project is to design a concept for a programming language. You do not need to implement the language, nor do you need to provide a complete formal specification, but you do need to trace out the concept to a degree sufficient for a technical reader to understand how to write your language, and what sort of semantics should be expected.</p>
                        <p>The project is organized into three phases plus a presentation.</p>

                        <h3 id="phase-one"><a href="#phase-one">Phase One</a></h3>

                        <p>In phase one, you must submit a report on an existing programming language that is not in the Top 20 of the TIOBE programming language index at the time the class starts. This means the following languages may not be used for the report:</p>
                        <ul class="columns">
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>C</li>
                            <li>C++</li>
                            <li>C♯</li>
                            <li>Python</li>

                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Visual Basic .NET</li>

                            <li>Go</li>

                            <li>Visual Basic</li>
                            <li>MATLAB</li>
                            <li>PL / SQL</li>
                            <li>Objective-C</li>
                            <li>Scratch</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The phase 1 report is worth 40 points out of the 110 total points for the project. If a report on any of the languages listed above is turned in, it will receive 0 points.</p>
                        <p>The report should detail the language's syntax, semantics, paradigm, design philosophy, and major interesting features.</p>

                        <h3 id="phase-two"><a href="#phase-two">Phase Two</a></h3>

                        <p>In phase two, you must submit a report on an original programming language concept developed by the group. This report is a draft report, and will not be graded, but failure to submit a report in phase two will result in the group receiving no points for any submission in phase three.</p>
                        <p>Like in phase one, the report should detail the language's syntax, semantics, paradigm, design philosophy, and major interesting features.</p>

                        <h3 id="phase-three"><a href="#phase-three">Phase Three</a></h3>

                        <p>In phase three, you must submit the final draft of the report your group submitted in phase 2. This report is worth 40 points out of the 110 total points for the project.</p>

                        <h3 id="presentation"><a href="#presentation">Presentation</a></h3>

                        <p>The final part of the project is for the group to present their finished programming language concept. This presentation is worth 30 points out of the 110 total points for the project.
