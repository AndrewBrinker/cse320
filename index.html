                                        <p>This course requires the second edition of <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/2007-04-26/">&ldquo;Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation&rdquo;</a> by <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>. This book is available for free online in both <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> formats, and need not be purchased, although students may purchase it if they want to do so.</p>

                                        <p>Before each class, be sure to read any assigned chapters of the book, as well as any additional materials included in the syllabus.</p>

                                        <p>Each pre-course reading will include optional materials. Questions from these optional materials will be included for extra points in the quiz given at the start of each class session.</p>

                                        <p>Some pre-course reading will include links or suggestions for further exploration into the topic at hand. These are entirely for your own personal edification, and will not be required for use in the course.</p>

                                        <p>The class component will serve to enable discussion and exploration of the topics covered in reading. To do well in this class, <em>you must do the assigned reading</em>. Students who arrive to class without having done the reading will likely find themselves struggling.</p>
                                        <p>Each class session will begin with a quiz whose questions are based on the information covered in the reading assigned after the previous class session. Each quiz will additionally have questions based on any optional reading, for extra points. See the <a href="#grading">Grading</a> section for more information on how these quizzes are graded, and how that grade contributes to your final grade in the course.</p>

                                        <h3 id="lab-component"><a href="#lab-component">Lab Component</a></h3>

                                        <p>The lab component will serve to introduce you to a variety of programming languages, to provide practical knowledge about different languages, their underlying paradigms, and how the different decisions the language designers make influence the resulting language.

                            <h3 id="goals"><a href="#goals">Goals</a></h3>

                            <p>One of the goals of this course is to combat language monoculture. If you as a programmer only use one language, you are only exposed to one way of thinking. The languages we use (whether speaking or programming) shape the ideas we consider and express. Learning more than one programming language is akin to learning more than one spoken language. In doing so, you help to broaden yourself with new perspectives and ways of thinking.</p>
                            <p>It is not expected that you become a strong programmer in each of these languages. Rather, the hope is that the exposure you receive to these languages will pay dividends in improving your understanding of and facility with programming overall. If you happen to like one or more of these languages, and want to explore them further on your own time, do.</p>

                            <h3 id="Organization"><a href="#organization">Organization</a></h3>

                            <p>Labs in this class will consist of a series of exercises or a programming assignment in one of the <a href="#languages-in-the-lab">four languages being used in the lab</a>. These labs are designed to be reasonably completed within the hour and fifty minutes alloted. For students who finish with extra time and want to explore the languages in question further, additional resources or exercises will often be provided.</p>
                            <p>Lab time is a time for experimentation, discovery, and question-asking (both of yourself and of me). The best way to discover the workings of a programming language is to write in it, and so I highly recommend a sense of playfulness during lab sessions. I will be available for questions, and if more than one or two students has the same question I am happy to answer those questions for the edification of the rest of the students.</p>

                            <h3 id="languages-in-the-lab"><a href="#languages-in-the-lab">Languages in the Lab</a></h3>

                            <p>The lab is organized into four segments, each using a particular language. These languages were chosen because they best typify the core concepts of the programming paradigm they represent.</p>
                            <p>In these labs we will be using <em>Haskell</em> (to represent functional programming), <em>Rust</em> (to represent structured programming), <em>Java</em> (to represent object-oriented programming), and <em>Prolog</em> (to represent logic programming). These languages are all quite different, and there is enough nuance in each to fill multiple classes. So we will only be spending a few weeks with each language.</p>
