        <li>Chapter 8 of PLAI. It is highly recommend to do the exercises in the book.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The focus in this reading should be on the following concepts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What is a box? What is it used for?</li>
        <li>Why does adding sequencing require the interpreter to take and return the environment?</li>
        <li>What is the "store," and why is it needed? How does adding the store change the environment?</li>
        <li>How does adding state change the semantics of existing operations, like addition and multiplication?</li>
        <li>What is the difference between identifiers and variables?</li>
        <li>What are "call by value" and "call by reference?" What is the difference between them?</li>
    </ul>
