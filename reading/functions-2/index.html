        <li>How do functions and closures relate? Are functions closures? Are closures functions?</li>
        <li>What is the &ldquo;top-level&rdquo; of a program?</li>
        <li>What is <em>capture-free substitution</em>? Why is it necessary?</li>
        <li>What is <code>let</code>? How is it defined?</li>
    </ul>
